## Problem Statement - iCare Management

iCare is a retail store that manages various collection of iOS products. The company uses an excel file to keep track of products in the store. Now the company wants to have a user-friendly software to manage. The application must perform the following tasks.


    Four options to be displayed to end user as shown below.

        1. Add product
        2. View all products. 
        3. Search products based on price.
        4. Remove a product based on product id.

    • While adding a product, it must capture the Name, Description, Manufactured Year &
    Price. (Price is of double datatype).

    • If the user tries to save a product with Name & Manufactured Year that already exists, 
    then it should display ‘Product already exists!’.

    • Each product must be uniquely identified with an Id(int). This Id must be auto incremented
    and should start from 5000.
    • On selecting option 2, it must print all products. It must display Id, Name, Manufactured 
    Year &Price.

    • On selecting option 3, it must print all products with Price > user input price. It must 
    display Id, Name, Manufactured Year &Price.

    • On selecting option 4 it must remove a product with id equal to user input product id 
    and display “Product with Id= <id> is removed successfully”.


##### Note
    • Application must run if the user wants to continue.

    • Perform exception handling with proper messages.

    • Must use List in C#

    • Application must be user friendly.
