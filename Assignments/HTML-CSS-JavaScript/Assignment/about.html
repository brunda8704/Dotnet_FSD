        <strong>Cadbury Dairy Milk</strong> is a milk chocolate brand that was proposed in the U.k. in 1905 and has since expanded
        to include other goods.
        Its<br> chocolates are made using milk chocolate. It received the title of the finest
        chocolate in the United Kingdom in 2014. It has granted<br> Hershey's Group a license to make and sell chocolates
        in the United States.
        Cadbury's Dairy Milk, which has been melting our hearts for<br> the past seven decades, has
        revamped itself in each phase and spread joy.<br><br>

        According to a 2007 report in The New York Times, a British bar contained (in order) milk, sugar, cocoa mass,
        cocoa butter, vegetable fat<br>
        and emulsifiers, whilst the American version manufactured by Hershey started its list of ingredients with sugar. It also listed lactose,<br>
        emulsifier soy lecithin, and "natural and artificial flavorings".Cadbury supplied its chocolate crumb to Hershey, which then added cocoa<br>
        butter during processing. According to its spokesman, Cadbury tries to adapt the taste of the product to that which local consumers<br>
        are accustomed, meaning it is more akin to a Hershey bar for the US market.
